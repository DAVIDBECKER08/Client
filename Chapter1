Chapter 1: Creation of Server/Client on GCP and validating the code

create GCP account
Create project name
set the project
#gcloud config set project "project name" 
open cloudshell
git clone server(https://github/....)
cd to server and install npm, start npm

open cloudshell 
git clone client(https://github/....)
cd to client and install npm, start npm

start/preview/port

add dependencies (on server)

To Clone from github to Cloud Shell
cd
cd UI ---> into folder you need to be into
git pull http:etc.   (Whatever link is with the file need, e.g., UI/Backend)
npm install
npm audit
npm start

----------------------
To Initiate Github

cd
cd Backend
ls -a
npm install
npm start
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/tejamuddada/Backend.git  --> points to repository to copy
git push -u origin master ---> copies data over to other person's github


---
To checkout branch
git branch --> see which branc you are o
git pull origin <branch name> ---> git origin is shorthand for the originally repository mapped.  when this doesn't work, use the fetch/reset method below
git checkout <branch name> --> this points you to the new branch

git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master --> use this to refresh pull from git if accidently screw up code on local copy
